# Triggers

{% hint style='working' %}
This feature is still work in progress
{% endhint %}

Instead of loading next pages on scroll you can use a trigger. A trigger is a link or button that has to be clicked before the next page is loaded.

Reasons for a trigger might be:

* To make the footer reachable.
* To ease the load on the server. Users have to click before loading the next page. This adds a natural delay.
