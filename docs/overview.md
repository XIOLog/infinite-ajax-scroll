# What is Infinite Ajax Scroll?

Infinite Ajax Scroll is a javascript infinite scrolling plugin. It works by reading the next (and previous) links of your existing server-side pagination and load these pages via AJAX when the visitor scrolls to the end of the page.

This approach, also known as progressive enhancement, is SEO-friendly and offers your users a better user-experience, resulting in longer visitor times and more page views.

## Key features

* **Progressive enhancement**: Infinite Ajax Scroll progressively enhances your server-side pagination with AJAX. When a client doesn't support JavaScript it will fall back on your server-side pagination.
* **Back-button proof**: The browser url is automatically updated when you scroll between pages. Users can reload or bookmark the page and always return to the right page.
* **Highly customizable**: With it's flexible API and event based architecture you can adapt it to your needs.
